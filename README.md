DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/2021-2022-fall/#page-top

After I completed this university course I am able to:
better understand the impact of internal implementation choices (page, buffer, file manager, B+-tree and Hash indices, external sort and join algorithms, etc.) on the DBMS performance
adopt a principled approach to database tuning problems by choosing the appropriate internal system parameters (S/W configurations, data structures, query planning) in order to make it run faster for specific application needs
acquire an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of commercial (ORACLE, DB2, Sybase, SQLServer) and public domain (MySQL, Postgres) database systems

This course dealt with the following issues:
Storage and Index Structures
  Disks and files
  Tree and Hash Indices
  External Sorting
Query Processing and Optimization
  Relational Algebra Operator Implementation
  Logical and Physical Optimization of Relational Queries
  Relational Query Optimizer Architecture
Transaction Management
  Failure Recovery
  Synchronization Control
  Execution Plans and Serializability
  Locking
  Tree Protocols
